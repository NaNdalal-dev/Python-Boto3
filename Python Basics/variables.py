What is a Variable in Python?
A variable in Python is a container for storing data values. 
Unlike other programming languages, Python does not require explicit variable declaration.

 variable 'a' is integer type 
"""
print(a)

"""
Variable 'name' is type string.
Variable 'height' is type float.

print(name)
print(height)
